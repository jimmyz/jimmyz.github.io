I wrote about my new routine in an earlier post. I've switched my morning routine to make better use of the time, including exercise, writing, and study. I'm waking up at the same time as I usually do, but by changing the order of things and focusing my efforts, I've been able to achieve greater productivity.

Today is day four of the new routine. My schedule for this morning is such that it disrupted my usual morning plan. This is typically where my plans of a new routine go bad. I miss a day. I miss two days. I miss a week, a month, etc. This time, I thought consciously of how I would react to this disruption, and for the most part, I followed the adjusted plan. It was really tempting for me to justify sleeping in and bagging the plan, but nope.

Here's to another focused day of effort.
