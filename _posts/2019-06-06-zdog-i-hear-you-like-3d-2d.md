Yesterday, while scanning through the awesome [JavaScript Weekly Newsletter](https://javascriptweekly.com), I stumbled upon a really cool 2D rendering library named [Zdog](https://zzz.dog). The concept is way cool. It allows you to model three-dimensional objects and render the 3D models to the screen using purely two-dimensional shapes such as circles, ellipses, squares, etc. The end effect is really cool. [Check out some of the examples](https://zzz.dog/#made-with-zdog).

What is the practical application for such a library? I'm not really sure yet. Perhaps it could be used to render game graphics in a cool way. Or maybe it will simply be used to create really cool artwork. Nevertheless, it is way cool.

What practical application do you see for this type of rendering?
