I've made it through two full weeks of my new routine. I almost let myself off yesterday because I had things to prepare for an offsite that morning. Instead, I got up an extra half hour early so that I would make it to the gym. That was a real test for me because I was tired. 

One thing I'm learning from all of this is that I have to make the mental commitment and preparations the evening before. That way, when my body says, "I just want to keep sleeping", my mind already has a way to counter it and I'd be upset if my preparation was wasted.
