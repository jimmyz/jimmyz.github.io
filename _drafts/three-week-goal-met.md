I've hit three weeks of consistent exercise. This is the point at which I usually begin to pat myself on the back and get casual about exercise and things drop off.

Last night I was coming off of an exhausting day of Memorial Day activities and I just wanted to collapse into bed and skip my preparations for today. I'm glad I didn't because this morning I'm feeling good about the progress I've made. The real test is going to be when I actually miss a day or miss two days for unexpected circumstances. I'll cross that bridge when it comes.
