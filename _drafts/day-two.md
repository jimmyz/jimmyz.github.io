Today is day two of a new daily routine. I got tired of feeling like I wasn't living up to some of my personal ideals. I want to write. I want to be fit. I want to eat better. Lately, I've made excuses for eating garbage and for "not having time" to workout or to write. I also wasn't spending necessary time to focus on spiritual things.

I believe this new routine will help me to create a daily habit of exercise, study, and writing. I'm waking up at the same time. I'm just making a better use of my time.

So, this is day two. I'm going to take this a day at a time.
