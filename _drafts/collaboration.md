For the last ten years, my work has required intense collaboration across many internal divisions many external companies and teams. In almost all of these scenarios, I've had no authority over the people I've worked with. However, I've been responsible for delivering software, programs, and integrations that bring value to the organization. Here are the things I've learned along the way.

Build relationships of trust
Establish a vision
Define clear objectives and goals
Communicate frequently
Keep management informed

## Build Relationships of Trust

Good relationships have been my most valuable asset in my work. I'm not just talking about getting people to like you. It is important to build trust. People need to:

- Trust that your intentions are pure. You do this by being genuine and by having no hidden agendas.
- Trust that you are competent. This may require studying up on things outside of your job role, asking lots of questions, finding the experts and listening to what they have to say.
- Trust that you will do what you say you are going to do. Get quick wins with other teams by following up on commitments in a timely manner.

When people trust you, they listen to what you have to say. This is crucial when you begin establishing a joint vision.

## Establish a Joint Vision

Whether it is large initiative or a small project, it is important for those involved to understand what it is you are trying to accomplish *and* why it matters. For example, "We need to launch a new developer portal that will do the following things... It should something like... The reason this is important is because it will..."

Before teams take will take action, or before management funds the project with dollars or priority, people need to feel that there is a sense of urgency. The urgency needs to be real and not fabricated. People see through fabricated urgency really easily. Again, this points to establishing and maintaining trust with everyone you work with.

## Define Clear Objectives and Milestones

When clear objectives and milestones are defined, things move. Without them, you spin your wheels. I've experienced plenty of spin which could have been avoidable if I had just established milestones. I like putting names on certain milestones and then breaking down the things that need to be done to hit that. The names don't need to be fancy, but need to be something memorable that can be referenced in conversation.

- "Thin thread validation"
- "Phase 1 Pilot release"
- "Phase 1 Production release"

Put a date on when you plan to hit the phase.

## Communicate Frequently

Communicate with your teams frequently.
