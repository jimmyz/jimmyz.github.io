I work for [FamilySearch International](https://www.familysearch.org) as manager of the Partner Solutions team. I love what I do because I have the opportunity of working with and serving amazing people and companies. I have a background in software development, API integrations, and business development.

In my (almost) nonexistent free time, I play drums, listen to 80s rock ballads, write code, experiment with Linux distributions, play Minecraft with my kids, and geek out on most things Star Wars.

I'm a member of [The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints](https://churchofjesuschrist.org), which means I strive to live by the teachings of Jesus Christ as found in The Holy Bible and the [Book of Mormon](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm?lang=eng). I believe that family is an important part of God's plan for all of us and I feel blessed to devote so much of my time helping people connect with their families.
